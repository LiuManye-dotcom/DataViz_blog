## Original Data Visualization

The original data visualization looks like the graph presented below:
![](img/image01.jpg)
The graph presented Singapore’s merchandise trade performance with 10 major trading partners in 2020. It is created by using data provided by the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). The data can be download under the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market.


## Part A: Critique of Visualisation

### Clarity

1. **Missing Title:** The title cannot be found in the image provided. This means no insights were highlighted and audiences cannot catch the key information this visualization tries to deliver immediately.  

2. **Axis title:** Titles and labels for both axes fail to indicate the unit of measure for the exports and imports value presented. Since the unit of measure for both axes is unclear, we also have a problem finding out if these axes are synchronized or not.

3. **Unclear message delivery:** The original visualization tries to indicate whether a particular trading partner is a net exporter or a net importer by showing which color region (green or blue) its center point falls. For some trading partners, it is hard to tell which region do they fall in because of the crowdedness and unreasonable graph design. Some circles are too big, and this makes it hard for the audience to see the position of the center points. Circles cover up each other when these trading partners share similar merchandise trading values, and some center points cannot be seen at all. This makes the graph unclear and very difficult to read.

4. **Too much information: ** The original visualization contains too much information at the same time, and this makes it hard to read:
* The size of the circle and information in the tooltips reflect the size of total merchandise trading value instead of the imports and exports value presented on axes. This could be confusing to the audience.
* The background of the original graph separates trading partners into two groups: those that have positive merchandise trading balance with Singapore and those that have negative ones.
* The annotations of star signs with different color backgrounds indicate trading partners that have the greatest net import/export value. These annotations are placed above tooltips that contain total merchandise trading value, which could be misleading.
* No labels or legends are shown in the graph to indicate the information indicated by the color and size of the circles and the background color. Legends of the star signs are placed under the long notes of the graph, and this makes the graph hard to read. Audiences need to read the long notes to understand the complicated design of the original visualization.

5. **One-year trading details only** Only the trading details of 2020 are visualized in the original graph. The variations and changes in the trade performance of these top trading partners cannot be seen.


### Aesthetic

1. **Missing Tick Mark:** Tick marks are necessary on a continuous scale. They help to mark the major divisions and show the exact point on the axis. Tick marks are missing for both axes in the original visualization. 

2. **Poor color choice:** 
* **For the bubbles:** The colors of different circles represent different trading partners. However, some colors in the original graph are do not sufficiently contrast with each other. For instance, the colors of Thailand and the EU are almost the same. Red and Green are used at the same time, which is not friendly to color blinder readers. 
* **For the background:** The light green and blue combination for the background is not a wise choice as light colors with similar tones could be easily ignored by the readers. 
* **Transparency:** Transparency of the circle should be used to avoid occlusion issue.

3. **Messy Tooltip:** Tooltip for all the circles are always showed in the original visualization. In this way, key information and significant findings cannot be highlighted.


## Part B: Alternative Design

The proposed alternative visualization design is displayed below:

### Advantages of the new design

#### Clarity

1. Clear titles are provided to indicate the purpose of the graphs and help audiences to catch the key information quickly.
2. Clear axes title and labels are displayed.
3. Use different colors and sizes to assist readers to compare the differences between different years or different trading partners
4. A reference line is provided to assist the audience to read the visualizations. 
5. There is a Clear theme for each chart, not too much information at once.
6. Edited Tooltips that help to highlight the key message
7. Interactive filters and motion play allow the audience to access more trading information

#### Aesthetic

1. Tick marks can be seen by the audiences and help them to identify the divisions on the axis.
2. Legends are hidden or replace by direct labels to improve the tidiness of the visualization.
3. Transparency is used to avoid occlusion issues.
4. Contrasting colors are used to help to deliver the information and improve the aesthetic design of the visualization. 
5. Only important information will be labeled. This also improves the tidiness of the graphs.


## Part C: Proposed Visualisation

## Part D: Step-by-step Guide
After downloading data from the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS), the instruction below will illustrate how can we prepare the proposed alternative data visualization step-by-step.

### Data Preparation
Unzip the output folder downloaded from the website. Reorganizing the data by using Excel and Tableau for further use. All the steps below should be operated for both T1 and T2 sheets that contain Imports and Exports trading data separately.

* **Step 1:** Delete unnecessary rows and content sheets in the original file for the convenience of future operations. Since this DataViz Makeover will only focus on top trading partners that are included in the original visualization (Mainland China, Malaysia, Indonesia, United States. Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, EU, Republic of Korea, and Thailand). The study period is set to be between January 2011 to December 2020. We can high-lighted the data of the desired partners and remove the undesired data. The cleaned data looks like the image below:

* **Step 2:** Select all the remaining data in T1 and T2 and paste them in newly created datasheets named ‘Imports’ and ‘Exports’. Select the Transpose option while pasting. In this way, we can have the exports and imports value of each trading partner presented separately.

* **Step 3:** In the original dataset, European Union has different units (Million Dollars) from the other trading partners (Thousand Dollars). To make it easier for audiences to read the data visualization that will be created, I decided to unify the measuring unit for all trading partners to Million Dollars. To do this, I recalculate the value for every trading partner except the EU by dividing the original value over 1000 and then replace the old imports/exports value with the new ones.

* **Step 4:** Save the cleaned excel file and open it in Tableau. Drag ‘Imports’ in the main pane. Select every variable except ‘Variables’, right-click and select Pivot. Two Pivot Field variables that contain trading partners and Import value will be generated.

* **Step 5:** Right-click the newly created pivot variable that contains trading partner data and select ‘split’. A new variable will be generated which contains the trading partner’s information only. “(Million Dollars)” that shows repeatedly in every cell will be removed.

* **Step 6:** Hide the variable that contains both trading partner information and measure unit. Set the three remaining variables into the correct data format. The original “Variables” is renamed as “Time” and set in Date format. The newly split variable is renamed as “Trading Partners” and plays as Country/Region. The last pivot variable is renamed as “Imports” and set into a Number (decimal) data format. Maximize the number of rows presented to ensure all instances in the dataset can be seen in Tableau.

* **Step 7:** Repeat steps 4 to 6 for the Exports dataset. Copy the values for 4 variables “Time”, “Trading Partners”, “Imports”, and “Exports”. Paste these four variables in a newly created excel sheet called **Final Data**.
