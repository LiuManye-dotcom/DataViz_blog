## Original Data Visualization

The original data visualization looks like the graph presented below:
![](img/image01.jpg)
The graph presented Singaporeâ€™s merchandise trade performance with 10 major trading partners in 2020. It is created by using data provided by the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). The data can be download under the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market.


## Part A: Critique of Visualisation

### Clarity

1. **Missing Title:** The title cannot be found in the image provided. This means no insights were highlighted and audiences cannot catch the key information this visualization tries to deliver immediately.  

2. **Axis title:** Titles and labels for both axes fail to indicate the unit of measure for the exports and imports value presented. Since the unit of measure for both axes is unclear, we also have a problem finding out if these axes are synchronized or not.

3. **Unclear message delivery:** The original visualization tries to indicate whether a particular trading partner is a net exporter or a net importer by showing which color region (green or blue) its center point falls. For some trading partners, it is hard to tell which region do they fall in because of the crowdedness and unreasonable graph design. Some circles are too big, and this makes it hard for the audience to see the position of the center points. Circles cover up each other when these trading partners share similar merchandise trading values, and some center points cannot be seen at all. This makes the graph unclear and very difficult to read.

4. **Too much information: ** The original visualization contains too much information at the same time, and this makes it hard to read:
* The size of the circle and information in the tooltips reflect the size of total merchandise trading value instead of the imports and exports value presented on axes. This could be confusing to the audience.
* The background of the original graph separates trading partners into two groups: those that have positive merchandise trading balance with Singapore and those that have negative ones.
* The annotations of star signs with different color backgrounds indicate trading partners that have the greatest net import/export value. These annotations are placed above tooltips that contain total merchandise trading value, which could be misleading.
* No labels or legends are shown in the graph to indicate the information indicated by the color and size of the circles and the background color. Legends of the star signs are placed under the long notes of the graph, and this makes the graph hard to read. Audiences need to read the long notes to understand the complicated design of the original visualization.

5. **One-year trading details only** Only the trading details of 2020 are visualized in the original graph. The variations and changes in the trade performance of these top trading partners cannot be seen.


### Aesthetic

1. **Missing Tick Mark:** Tick marks are necessary on a continuous scale. They help to mark the major divisions and show the exact point on the axis. Tick marks are missing for both axes in the original visualization. 

2. **Poor color choice:** 
* **For the bubbles:** The colors of different circles represent different trading partners. However, some colors in the original graph are do not sufficiently contrast with each other. For instance, the colors of Thailand and the EU are almost the same. Red and Green are used at the same time, which is not friendly to color blinder readers. 
* **For the background:** The light green and blue combination for the background is not a wise choice as light colors with similar tones could be easily ignored by the readers. 
* **Transparency:** Transparency of the circle should be used to avoid occlusion issue.

3. **Messy Tooltip:** Tooltip for all the circles are always showed in the original visualization. In this way, key information and significant findings cannot be highlighted.
